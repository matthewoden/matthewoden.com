I know there's not a lot of mac folks in here (actually, are there any besides me?) but screenotate.com is a wonderful tool. Not free - but having OCR on all your screenshots, so you have searchable, annotated results? Super nice.

Especially with the number of video calls/meetings I have - I've been screencapping when folks share their screen so I can grab a url, or text off a slide or whatever's being shared without interrupting anyone.

Started using Bear for notes, and I'm a big, big fan. I love the hybrid markdown approach, where it keeps the markdown syntax, but also applies the formatting. e.g. _Some bold text_ and /some italic text/

Also, little things like tagging, instead of folders. And any note that uses checkboxes (that aren't all checked) showing up in a "TODO" section. Like many of the tools I use, it's mac only.
