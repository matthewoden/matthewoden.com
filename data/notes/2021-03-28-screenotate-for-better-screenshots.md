change to the table.

Working remote for the past year or so, I've found a few tools that have helped with
with collaboration. Most of them focus on being local to my machine, since I work
for a traditionally non-remote organization.

For note taking and reference, I've found [screenotate](https://screenotate.com) to be a wonderful tool. It does an OCR pass on all of your screenshots. This makes every screenshot you take searchable - and transcribes urls, texts, and presentations for later use. You can take a screenshot of someone else's browser, and grab a long url to check out later.

It also lets you set shortcuts - so you can copy the screenshot, or the OCR'd text to the clipboard.

For whiteboarding, [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) is my go-to solution. I love that it's intentionally sloppy. I don't waste any time on getting every little box to line up, and focus on getting ideas out of my head. There's no account needed to use, E2E encryption, and it's developed to provide a local-first experience. Whenever you're ready, you simply share your current URL to start a collaborative session.

Whenever you're sharing your screen, [telestrator](https://github.com/steveruizok/telestrator) is my must-have tool. It lets you you draw on you screen, helping your audience know where to look at any given time. The drawings fade after a second or two, so they're never in the way. Perfect for demos, bug reports, or other presentations.
